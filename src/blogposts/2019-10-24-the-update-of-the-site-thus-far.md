Monday, August 12. It’s a public holiday in Malaysia. No Monday-blues, or so we thought. I’m driving my car, with a teary-eyed wife by my side, heading home after an incident.

We had planned to go around Pasar Seni (a tourist attraction in the heart of Kuala Lumpur) for a fun photoshoot. I had suggested it the night before and that thrilled her. Over breakfast, I looked up some articles on how to shoot better photographs with people and one of the tips was to be a good people person. “I can do that, ” I thought to myself, “she’s my wife! It’s going to be a great day.”
When I was about to be done with breakfast, she pulled out her phone and busy tapping away. Looking at her screen, I saw that she was doing some work for a festival which we were both on the committee for. Being the great husband that I am, I wait for her to be done with that. I observed what’s around, taking it all in as this wasn’t a place we frequented.

After what felt like an eternity (it was probably 10 minutes), I looked at her phone in mild irritation. Being the perceptive woman that she was, she gestured for us to leave even though she wasn’t done. I felt a slight pang of guilt and thought to myself, “I’ve waited so long, why not a little while more?” So I mentioned for her to send it out first before we head off and proceeded to wait a little more.

I suppose a lot was going through my head while all these was taking place. Many of which I probably had no idea was taking place in me. When she had sent out the message, I realised that my mood had somehow change. While walking out of the breakfast joint, I murmured, “Now that YOU are done with WORK, where shall we go?” It’s curious how irritation can evolve directly into a beast that is anger.

That was the flash point for the floodgates of pissy moods to break within me and now I’m upset at my wife. The love of my life whom I had hugged this morning on the bed, thanking God for having her in my life, is now the object of my anger. How did I get from there to here? Why did I lash out to her in anger? That’s what I’m curious about now, so I did some reading online.

If you got here only to find out why I’m angry at my wife, you now know. But if you would like to read more about what I’ve learnt on anger, read on.

##Why do people get angry?
I was curious as to why I had behaved the way I did. So I turned to my friendly helper, Google and found a couple of useful links.

> Anger is an emotion characterised by antagonism toward someone or something you feel has deliberately done you wrong. — American Psychological Association

Did my wife deliberately wrong me? Well, no. She was merely getting some important work done. But that didn’t stop me from lashing out at her. What gives?

Anger is a natural and mostly automatic response to pain of one form or another (physical or emotional). Anger can occur when people don’t feel well, feel rejected, feel threatened, or experience some loss.

> The type of pain does not matter; the important thing is that the pain experienced is unpleasant. Because anger never occurs in isolation but rather is necessarily preceded by pain feelings, it is often characterised as a ‘’secondhand’’ emotion. — MentalHelp.net

Ah, I see. I must have felt rejected when she seemed to be prioritising work over plans which we have made the night before. While I’m sure this was not her intention, it felt that way to me and thus it escalated into anger. Maybe I have anger issues, but it seems that this very mild form of rejection isn’t enough for anger to manifest itself. There must be something which triggered it. Turns out, it was anger-triggering-thoughts.

According to mentalhelp.net, some anger-triggering-thoughts include “personal assessments, assumptions, evaluations, or interpretations of situations that makes people think that someone else is attempting (consciously or not) to hurt“ me.

I figured that while I was waiting for her to be done with her work on the phone, I must have been brooding over the fact, playing with assumptions in my head and interpreting her actions differently than what she intended. That became the spark which lighted the fire. Reflecting on other situations, I came to realise the truth in this.

Often we are merely annoyed with others when they do something which doesn’t sit right with us. However, if we keep replaying those scenarios in our minds with assumptions, evaluations and interpretations of situations thrown in, we may just find ourselves lashing out at others when we find ourselves in that situation again.

But so many of us also find ourselves staying angry even after the issue is over. Why is that the case? Isn’t being angry at someone just like ingesting poison with the intention to hurt someone else (or some variation of that). That might be the case, but it still doesn’t stop us from staying angry. Why? Because anger makes us feel… right.

##Why do people stay angry?
The pleasure of anger — the gnawing attraction which makes one return again and again to its theme — lies, I believe, in the fact that one feels entirely righteous when one is angry. Then the other person is pure black, and you are pure white. — C.S. Lewis

There is pleasure in anger. Many of us like drinking poison to hurt others. Why? Because this poison tastes sweet, at least for the moment. For those of us who indulge in anger, we get to feel the sweet sense of righteousness, the feeling that we are justified in feeling angry because someone else is the one at fault. We are the perfect party and the victim. We scheme in our minds, whether consciously or not, on how we can repay the hurt we have experienced on the ‘guilty party’.
Now, writing all these at this point is really making me feel like an utter fool for being upset with my wife earlier (I am a rational man, after all). So are there moments, then, where anger actually helps with something?

##Moments when anger actually help
I can think of two situations where being angry at something can be translated into something positive:

**Anger helps us right a wrong.** Whether it is global warming or racism we feel strongly about, anger about the issue helps us take action about the issue. It could be as simple an action as telling others about the issue over a casual conversation. Your anger towards the issue would bubble up during your conversation and that could serve as a persuasive tool to convince others to also take action for the cause you believe in.

**Anger protects us from being taken advantage of.** The man who stands too closely to you in a crowded train or the woman who cuts into a queue that you have been standing in for the past 2 hours: being angry in these situations prevent you from being taken advantage of and when you voice up against it, not only do you send a clear signal that you are no pushover, but you also protect others and empower them to stand up for their rights.

Ultimately, being angry induces us to **take action and reject the status-quo.** Indeed the many people who have made a difference in the world around us have probably done so out of a sense of indignation against the status quo which they found themselves in.

##When anger doesn’t help at all
I’ve come a long way, emotionally, since sitting down to write this article. I’ve come to learn that anger is but a secondary emotion which we go through when we feel hurt or rejected. While there are good reasons for being upset, being upset with my wife because she was getting some quick work done for a cause which the both of us believed in doesn’t help. Not one bit.

I’m no longer angry.
